This GitHub pages site is a work in progress while I learn the ins and outs of building a static site with Jekyll etc. Previously I've built sites based on Python (flask, django), RubyonRails, React/Nodejs. I'm a generalist and enjoy learning the different frameworks, stacks and new technology.  I come from the Microsft .NET world and I'm preparing myself for the future of open-source and cloud computing. If you need someone who can wear many hats (QA/dev/mgr), send me an email <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" target="_blank">{{ site.email }}</a>
